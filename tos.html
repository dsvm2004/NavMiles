      <h2 class="section-title">18) Binding Arbitration; Class-Action Waiver</h2>
      <p class="body-text">
        <span class="highlight">Arbitration:</span> Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration administered by a
        recognized provider (e.g., AAA) under its applicable rules. Arbitration will take place in Kent County, Michigan (or by video/teleconference if mutually agreed). Judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p class="body-text">
        <span class="highlight">Class-Action Waiver:</span> You and Company agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.
        The arbitrator may not consolidate claims or preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.
      </p>
      <p class="body-text">
        <span class="highlight">Small Claims Exception & Opt-Out:</span> Either party may seek relief in small claims court for qualifying disputes. You may opt out of arbitration within 30 days of first accepting these Terms

      <p class="body-text">
        We are not liable for any delay or failure to perform due to causes beyond our reasonable control, including acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, labor disputes, government actions,
        internet or telecommunications failures, or third-party service interruptions.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">20) Miscellaneous</h2>
      <p class="body-text">
        These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service and supersede all prior agreements. If any provision is held unenforceable, it will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible,
        and the remaining provisions will remain in full force. You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent; we may assign them without restriction. No waiver is effective unless in writing and signed by us.
